Note: The data for “150-oxy-ZrO2” in the “ZrO2-O2-distribution.xslx” file (file path: MD-related/ORR/ZrO2/O2 distribution) was inadvertently copied into “150-oxy-Pt” in the “Pt-O2-distribution.xslx” file (file path: MD-related/ORR/Pt/O2 distribution). The data for “150-oxy-Pt” is available at https://github.com/yhzhao1989/150-oxy-Pt.
